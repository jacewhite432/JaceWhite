 <h2>Sectoral Bargaining Op-Ed</h2>

  <p>In my first published article for National Review, I took on "sectoral bargaining," a scheme that gives union bosses control over entire industries.</p>
  <p>Excerpt:</p>
  <blockquote>    
  <p>Kamala Harris argued that unions should be organized “sector by sector” on the 2019 campaign trail, and pro-union academics at Harvard proposed a scheme that would give control of a sector to a union if it demonstrated support from just 10 percent of the sector’s workforce. </p>
  <p>Under current laws, the government will only give unions control of one workplace at a time, but sectoral bargaining can be established in heavily regulated industries where the supply of labor is tightly controlled, as with dockworkers, teachers, and elevator mechanics. </p>
  <p> Oren Cass of American Compass — a self-styled “conservative” group that has received significant funding from the Hewlett Foundation, which also helped fund the Harvard proposal mentioned above — said the elevator industry “presents one of the rare successful examples of sectoral bargaining in American industrial-labor relations.”</p>   
  <p> Cass praised the elevator monopoly because it means manufacturers can’t “squeeze workers” to cut costs.   
  <p> But Cass ignores the workers who are “squeezed” by not being hired because the elevator union restricts entry to protect its monopoly position. He also ignores the non-elevator workers on construction projects who are “squeezed” because the money that would have covered their paychecks is diverted to the elevator cartel.</p>
